<h3 align='center'>Let's give our backyard a makeover!✨</h3>
<p align='center'>25 out of 30 people are usually pretty unhappy about how their backyard looks. Even if some people like it at first, they don't know how to maintain it. Having a beautiful backyard is very crucial. You might not believe it but it has so many benifits. Healthwise, a good garden is great for your heart and reduces your stress. Moreover maintaining a backyard can build self-esteem! Maybe you don’t think you were born with a green thumb, but after tilling, planting, nurturing and harvesting plants, you might see a slightly different person in the mirror: a person who can grow things and is a little more in tune with the earth. It always feels good to accomplish new tasks, and if you can grow a garden, what can’t you do? But don't get overwhelmed! We are here with Backover or Backyard Makeover which makes having a beautiful backyard garden a cake walk!</p>

## What is it? ⛹️‍♂️
Backover is a combination of two key features in a backyard - Building a pretty backyard and maintaining it. So, first we have an easy to use AR application, where you can take a picture of your backyard. Backover will calculate the area of your backyard and give you design suggestions based on your garden. You can also view our gallery where people who love their garden have uploaded their photos for the world to see. Well after using our app, we're sure, your backyard photo will come up in no time. Next, we have a plant disease detection system to help you maintain your garden. Just click a picture and find out if there is any issue. If there is, don't worry we'll also be giving you a solution along with it!

## How we built it 🤖
We built the AR application using ARCore and flutter to take the measurements. The suggestions for the different designs were taken through a form and updated in MongoDB database after approval from the admin. For the admin, we created a Vue application that makes an API call to display all the suggestions and approve the ones fit for the app. Moreover, we built the plant detection model using Keras, Tensorflow and Inception v3. We connected tensorflow lite with dart and this part was coded in Google Colab. Lastly we used Cloudinary to store all our assets on the cloud for better performance of the app.

## Challenges we ran into 🥺


## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
Firstly, we were able to learn so much in just one day including an entire tech stack i.e. app development using Flutter. Along with that we made a lot of features that we didn't even think would be possible to do and we had so much fun creating them. But most importantly, we understand the dilema people face while choosing the correct vendor and design from the set of 10 designs for their backyard , and also save those who keeps us alive - plants! . And this is our biggest achievement. It feels great creating something which can actually help someone and make an impact on someone's life.

## What we learned 🤓
Being a group of javascript developers, we tried our hands on Flutter this time. We learnt how to create an onboarding screen, proper navigation, optimize controllers and make API calls. It was the first time we tried to connect node backend with mongodb with flutter, moreover we also tried to build our own detector model while taking data from kaggel and keras as the backend with tensorflow. In addition to that , we learned how to connect tensorflow lite with dart and use image picker to it's full extent!
